# Permits MCP — Claude operating manual

You are connected to **Permits MCP** (protocol id \`permits-gcs\` so existing connectors keep working; GitHub repo \`permits-GCs\`). Jobs:

1. **Live PermitStack commercial GC pulls for ANY US market** via \`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` (alias \`shovels_pull_calling_list\`) — **not timezone-restricted, not TX-only**
2. **DFW cache** (Dallas / Fort Worth / Rockwall) — free via \`save_calling_list\`
3. **PermitStack request estimates** — 1 HTTP request per search page (100/day on free)
4. **Calling lists in Supabase** — persist pulls so Cayden can filter them for cold calling
5. **Appraisal-district commercial parcels** (Dallas DCAD, Tarrant TAD, Collin CCAD)
6. **Operator rollup** by normalised mailing address (\`build_operators\`) — free

The old Propwire → LoopNet → Google property-owner cascade was **removed**. Do not offer it.

This server surfaces public permit + parcel records and state-board owner names for Email Finder \`name_company\` mode. Prefer the name **Permits MCP**. Protocol id alias: \`permits-gcs\`. Never call PDL. Never dump lead names in tool replies.

## Geography (critical — Cayden)
- Cayden may search **whenever he wants, anywhere in the US**. There is **no timezone gate** and **no Texas-only filter** on live PermitStack tools.
- **Live pull:** \`permitstack_pull\` (alias \`shovels_pull\`) fetches from PermitStack into the same store \`permits_contractors_query\` / \`save_calling_list\` read. Until you pull, that store is Dallas / Fort_Worth / Rockwall_County only — other places return 0 matched, not "no coverage".
- \`max_records\` is required and checked **before** each request. \`dry_run=true\` resolves geos with 0 credits. Cursors persist in \`pull_state.json\` for resume after restart.
- Prefer \`page_size=100\` on trial keys (1 request per page). On record-metered keys, estimate first at size=1.
- **Counties:** pass \`"Hillsborough County, FL"\` / \`"Denton County, TX"\`. Live search uses PermitStack **jurisdiction**, not \`city=Hillsborough\`. A 0-result county is \`county_query_empty\` (loud error), never silent \`no_coverage\`. Prefer a city (Tampa, FL) or ZIPs when the county jurisdiction is empty.
- **ZIPs:** \`"75001;75035;75201"\` resolve as geo_ids. Phone hydration needs \`contractor_id\` on the permit (or a name→id resolve). If every row is \`name:\` only, the tool refuses \`has_phone=true\` instead of writing empty phones.
- **resolve_only=true** on \`shovels_estimate_credits\` maps geos with **0 probe credits**.
- East coast → \`geos=east_coast\`. West coast → \`geos=west_coast\`.
- Flow: resolve_only / dry_run → estimate → \`shovels_pull\` → \`permits_contractors_query(place=…)\`.
- A \`coverage=no_coverage\` after a **city** resolve is a valid answer (thin coverage). A county 0 is \`county_query_empty\`.
- \`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` skips already-seen contractor ids **before** hydration (\`duplicates_skipped\` / \`distinct_contractors_added\`). \`max_records\` is surviving rows after contact filters; \`max_requests\` (default = max_records) caps hydration. A second call on the same geo continues with **unseen** contractors. Hydration is paced under 60 req/min. Counters: \`hydrated_ok\` / \`hydrated_rate_limited\` / \`hydrated_failed\` / \`hydrated_skipped_synthetic_id\` / \`contact_filter_yield\`. A restart from page 1 always sets \`restart_reason\`. Coverage is \`no_coverage\` / \`exhausted\` / \`empty_page\` / \`county_query_empty\` / \`ok\`. A county probe with \`items_on_probe=0\` is \`county_query_empty\` even if \`total_count\` is a permit total.

## Supabase target (critical)
- Every \`health\` and \`sync_to_supabase\` / \`save_calling_list\` response includes \`supabase_project\` + \`supabase_schema\`.
- This MCP writes to project **kemvxzhcxvynmoutwdrh** (schema \`permit_parcel\`, plus \`public.scrape_leads\`). Confirm before diagnosing "table missing".

## Context budget (critical)
- Results write **server-to-server** to Supabase via \`save_calling_list\` / \`shovels_pull_calling_list\` / \`sync_to_supabase\` / \`build_operators\`.
- Tool responses return **counts / small pages** only. Never dump thousands of rows into chat.
- After sync, verify with \`select count(*)\` (or the verify_sql the tool returns).

## When to use
- Any-US live PermitStack commercial contractor / GC list (East/West coast included)
- DFW commercial contractor / GC list (cached ~6,124)
- "How many PermitStack requests would this pull cost?"
- Save a pull so Cayden can filter a cold-calling list later
- Commercial parcel owners from DCAD / TAD / CCAD
- Grouping shell LLCs into real operators by tax-bill mailing address

## When NOT to use
- Google Maps local-business scrapes
- Propwire / LoopNet / residential rolls
- Institutional owners (REIT/fund/trust) — classify and **drop**
- Paid SOS / officer-unmasking lookups
- Smartlead sends / CRM writes

## Owner-type routing
\`owner_type\` on parcels:
- \`individual\` → owner is the decision maker
- \`local_llc\` → use \`build_operators\` + free Texas Comptroller PIR
- \`institutional\` → drop from private-operator outreach
- \`municipal\` → city/county/ISD/housing authority/etc. Different motion; segmentable, not "unknown"

## PermitStack key (do not rotate)
The live PermitStack key is already configured on the server (\`PERMITSTACK_API_KEY\`). **Do not ask Cayden to paste, rotate, or re-set it.** Do not call \`permitstack_set_api_key\` / \`shovels_set_api_key\` unless \`health\` shows \`permitstack_api_configured: false\`. Never echo the full key. Show only a masked fingerprint if asked "is the key set?"

## Owner-cell enrichment (Cayden)
Goal: dial **owner cells**, not office/main/license lines.
1. \`shovels_pull_calling_list\` (any US) or \`save_calling_list\` (DFW cache) or \`import_calling_list_csv\` (only if he already has a file)
2. \`score_calling_list\` (free). Default \`only_unscored=true\` — re-run until \`remaining_unscored=0\`. Limit up to 8,000.
3. \`match_state_owners(list_id, dry_run=true, max_rows=100)\` first, then without dry_run. Per-state tools stay callable. Texas Comptroller still: \`match_texas_officers(only_unmatched=true, limit=80)\`. Florida Sunbiz still: \`match_florida_officers(only_unmatched=true, limit=40)\`. Tool replies are counts / job ids / nameless samples only.
4. \`lookup_line_type\` — Veriphone Standard ~$2.40/1k. Show the $ estimate, then \`confirm=true\`. Default limit 50. Re-run \`only_unknown=true\` and **omit offset**. Invalid/non-NANP phones are marked \`invalid\` so the queue drains.
5. \`query_calling_list(dial_status=owner_cell)\` after line type for **match/resolved+mobile**. Verified mobiles with no owner identity are \`mobile_unverified_owner\` (including \`agent\`). Genuine person-name conflicts stay \`different\` but remain dialable. \`owner_people_search\` only if you still need a different number. Take **wireless** only if the address matches. \`record_owner_cell\`
6. Re-query \`query_calling_list(dial_status=owner_cell)\` after recording cells. \`officer_match\` is null until the state officer tool runs — never seeded as \`none\`.

Note: Shovels \`/v2/counties/{geo_id}/metrics/current\` has returned HTTP 500 while \`/metrics/monthly\` stayed healthy. Prefer monthly + contractor search; do not treat current-metrics 500 as a key failure.

Keys: \`set_enrichment_api_key\` for \`veriphone_api_key\`, \`texas_cpa_api_key\`, and optional \`florida_sos_api_key\`. Never echo them.

## PermitStack requests (always estimate when asked)
Call \`permitstack_estimate_credits\` (alias \`shovels_estimate_credits\`, or \`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` without confirm). Quote \`credits.estimated_requests\` — 1 HTTP request per search page. Cached list tools still cost 0. Do not ask anyone to rotate the PermitStack key.

## Workflows

### Contractors (PermitStack) + calling lists
1. If they ask cost → \`permitstack_estimate_credits\` (any geos)
2. **Any US market (incl. East/West coast):** \`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` → show estimate → \`confirm=true\` with \`owner=cayden\`, \`exclude_national_chains=true\`, \`has_phone=true\`
3. **DFW cache only:** \`permits_contractors_*\` then \`save_calling_list\` (0 requests)
4. Later: \`list_calling_lists(owner=cayden)\` → \`query_calling_list(has_phone=true, exclude_national_chains=true)\`
5. CSV import only if Cayden already has a file — do not require CSV for non-DFW

### Parcels
1. \`parcels_counties\` — every registered county, including the 60-mile Dallas set
2. \`parcels_summary\` / \`parcels_count\` / \`parcels_owners_count\` (counts only; owners are distinct mailing addresses)
3. \`parcels_query\` (max 50) for any registered county. Filters include improved, is_church, owner_type, max_miles_from_dallas
4. \`parcels_load(county, state)\` downloads one county. Adding a county is a row in data/parcels/counties.json
5. \`sync_to_supabase\` with dataset=parcels and client_tag writes the matching key set
6. \`build_operators\` for mailing-address rollup (counts only)

## Identity
- **Name:** Permits MCP
- **Server id:** \`permits-gcs\` (kept as the connector alias; changing it would break existing configs)
- **Package:** \`permits-mcp\` (\`permits-gcs-mcp\` / \`permit-parcel-mcp\` bins still work)
- **Jobs:** Live PermitStack pulls for any US market + free DFW cache + request estimates + Supabase calling lists + DCAD/TAD/CCAD parcels + mailing-address operators
- **Supabase:** project reported in \`health\` / sync responses (expect \`kemvxzhcxvynmoutwdrh\` / schema \`permit_parcel\`)
- **Removed:** Propwire / LoopNet / Google owner cascade
- **Geography:** No timezone / TX-only restriction on live PermitStack search

## PermitStack key
Already on the server. Do not ask Cayden to rotate it.

## PermitStack requests + live pull
Estimate with \`permitstack_estimate_credits\` (any geos). Pull with \`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` — first call without confirm shows cost; \`confirm=true\` spends and writes the list. Aliases: \`east_coast\`, \`west_coast\`, city/\`City, ST\`, state codes. \`shovels_*\` tool names still work.

## Calling lists (Cayden)
\`permitstack_pull_calling_list\` for any US market. \`save_calling_list\` for the DFW cache. \`import_calling_list_csv\` only when he already has a CSV. Filter with \`list_calling_lists\` / \`query_calling_list\`. Prefer \`has_phone=true\` and \`exclude_national_chains=true\`. Do not drop low-permit locals.

## Sync rules
- No silent 50k truncation — full matching set, or fail loudly
- Upsert parcels on \`(county, account_id)\`
- If scrape \`rows_inserted > 0\` but \`permit_parcel_schema_upserted = 0\`, treat as error
- Always prefer sync/save + SQL \`select count(*)\` over dumping rows into chat

## Operators
\`build_operators\` groups by normalised mailing address (strip C/O, ATTN, %, CARE OF). Excludes out-of-state (spelled + 2-letter codes), tax departments, and municipal owners by default.

## Free PIR path
Do not buy paid SOS unmasking for bulk LLCs. Use Texas Comptroller Public Information Reports after operator rollup (Texas entities) or \`match_florida_officers\` for Florida Sunbiz public records. Registered agent ≠ owner.
`;

export const WHEN_TO_USE_MARKDOWN = `# When to use Permits MCP

## Yes
- Live PermitStack commercial GC lists for **any US market** (East/West coast, city, county, state)
- Cached DFW commercial contractor contacts (~6,124)
- Estimate PermitStack request cost for a filter
- Save / filter cold-calling lists in Supabase (Cayden or anyone)
- Commercial parcels from Dallas / Tarrant / Collin appraisal districts
- Operator rollup by mailing address (\`build_operators\`)

## No
- Propwire/LoopNet cascade (removed)
- Maps local businesses
- Institutional fund/REIT owners (drop them)
- Bulk row dumps through chat — use shovels_pull_calling_list / save_calling_list / sync_to_supabase
- Refusing non-DFW / coast pulls (that restriction is gone)

## Money
Cached DFW queries + calling-list writes from the file are 0 credits. A live pull costs about **1 credit per API page (size=100)** on free/trial, or **1 credit per company** on paid — confirm which meter the key uses. Always estimate before \`confirm=true\`.
